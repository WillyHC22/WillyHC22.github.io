I recently completed my dual degree program with a MPhil in Electronic and Computer engineering from <a href="https://hkust.edu.hk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HKUST</a>, and a Master of Engineering in applied mathematics from <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CentraleSupélec</a>.</p> <p>Before coming to Hong Kong, I was enrolled in CentraleSupélec where I got my Bachelor of Engineering and got introduced to programming and machine learning through interdisciplinary academic projects in astrophysics with the <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en/soil-structures-and-materials-mechanics-laboratory-mssmat-umr-cnrs-8579" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MSSMat Laboratory</a>. From 2021 onwards, I joined HKUST and the <a href="https://caire.ust.hk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Center for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAiRE)</a> where my interest shifted towards Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Conversational AI, more specifically focusing on task-oriented dialogue systems and large language models.</p> <p>During my MPhil, I had the opportunity to collaborate in multiple meaningful research projects to provide assistance to healthcare and community care for the elderly in Hong Kong, such as a <a href="https://portal.jcsmart.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Care Navigation Portal</a> for caregivers and local NGOs, a humanoid health care robot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2p99YPEPZk" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Grace</a> for patients, and a virtual companion for elderly in retirement home.</p> <p>If you are interested to collaborate, please reach out to me!</p> </body></html>
